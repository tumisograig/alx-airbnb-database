# Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins

## Objective

Master SQL joins by writing queries that combine data from multiple tables in the Airbnb Clone database.

## Queries

1. **INNER JOIN**: Retrieve all bookings along with the user details who made those bookings.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties without any reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Retrieve all users and all bookings, ensuring inclusion of users without bookings and bookings without a user link.

## Files

* `joins_queries.sql`: Contains the SQL scripts for the above joins.

## How to Run

1. Connect to your Airbnb Clone database in your SQL client.
2. Execute `joins_queries.sql`.
3. Verify the results for correctness and completeness.

# TaskÂ 1: Practice Subqueries

2. **Correlated Subquery:** Find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

## Files
- `subqueries.sql`: Contains the SQL scripts for the required subqueries.

## How to Run
